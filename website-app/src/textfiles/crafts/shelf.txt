This is a tiny shelf we made for the entrance to my friend's tiny apartment.

We messed up something in the top part of the shelf, but it still turned out good! It's been in use for almost a year and still looks brand new. I think it was made with birch wood.

One thing I realized was that it is annoying to live in an apartment because you don't have access to a garage of any kind. We had to go to my sister's place and borrow their housing complex's hobby room. Solid space, but having my own garage would be more comfortable and my goal is to have one within five years.
