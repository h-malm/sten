This is a wrench holder I made for my dad for his birthday  <3 his old one was falling apart.

I looked at the old one and tried to copy the format, but I messed up the position of the smaller ones. They are supposed to be pointed up.

I used jean fabric and some more sturdy fabric as the back-piece. It weighs a fuckton because of the wrenches, so we'll see how long it actually holds together.
