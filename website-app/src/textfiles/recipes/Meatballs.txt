Ingredients:

800g pork and beef mixed ground beef (7% fat)
2 onions
1.5dl breadcrumbs
2dl cream
4 eggs
2tsp saltb
white pepper
(optional) kryddpeppar for a Christmasy hint and more umami (idk the correct English equivalence. Could probably be substituted with some anchovy)
(optional) butter to fry them in

Steps:

Mix cream and breadcrumbs and let it sit for 10min. Chop and fry the onion in butter. Add it to the cream/breadcrumb mix, along with the rest of the ingredients (I suggest this order: onion, salt, pepper, (kryddpeppar), eggs, ground meat).

Roll into small balls and either put the on an oven tray into the oven at 220C (flipping them halfway) for 20min or until they're golden brown, or fry in butter in a pan until golden.

Serve with mashed potatos, bruns√•s, boiled carrots, and lingonberry jam.
