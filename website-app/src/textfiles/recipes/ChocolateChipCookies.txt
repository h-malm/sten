150g butter
1dl sugar
1dl brow sugar
1tsp vanilla sugar
1/2tsp salt
1 egg
1 eggyolk
5dl gluten-free flour (Preferably FinMix Semper)
1stp baking soda
200g dark chocolate

Melt the butter and let cool. Combine with sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla sugar. Add egg and yolk and mix.

Mix the rest of the ingredients except for the chocolate in a separate bowl. Add to the egg and butter mix and combine.

Chop the chocolate and mix into the dough. 

Refridgerate for at least 2 hours. 

Split into balls (circa 1,5tbsp sized balls) and bake at 200Â°C for 10min, or until they get some color at the bottom-most part.

Enjoy them freshly baked or leave them in the fridge for a couple of hours and eat them (as they keep together better when cold).
