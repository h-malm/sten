Ingredients:

1L milk
1tsp salt
4 eggs
5dl cornstarch
Butter for frying

Steps:

Mix all ingredients together using a whisk. Add around 2/3dl batter (depending on how wide your pan is. Mine is 28cm) in (a lot of) butter and fry until somewhat solid or until the pancake has some color in the edges. Flip, and do the same on the other side.
