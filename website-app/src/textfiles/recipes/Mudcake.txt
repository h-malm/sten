Ingredients:

150g butter
3 eggs
3dl sugar
2dl gluten-free flourmix (Recommend Semper's Finmix)
1dl cacao
vanilla sugar 1tsp
1.5tsp salt

Steps:

Butter and bread a pan. Melt the butter and let it cool. Mix eg and sugar in a bowl. Add all dry ingredients, and when combined, add the butter.

Bake in the oven in 175C for circa 15min, but keep an eye on it so that it doesn't turn entirely dry! It should be slightly jiggly when removed from the oven.

Serve with vanilla icecream or whipped cream, and strawberries.
