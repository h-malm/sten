This is the first larger item I knitted. It felt like a huge project to take on, but I am so proud that I finished and it turned out well!

It was a blue shirt for my friend and it took around three months of a couple of hours of knitting almost every night to finish it.

I love the colors. They all work great together and the finished look is a rustic 80s vibe.
