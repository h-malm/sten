This is the second shirt I knitted (also for a friend). It's made out of alpaca wool and it has a very simple pattern. It took around two months of vigorous knitting to finish.

Unfortunately, I did not take any final image of the shirt, but it looked great after some blocking. And it became sooo soft.
