                I'm a 23-year-old Computer Engineering student. My Master's thesis just got graded
                (I got a 4 out of 5. One could say I am pretty fucking proud). My Master's thesis
                discussed the
                evolution of website design, focusing on
                layout,
                colors, navigation, and
                visualized interactivity. Can't say it was anything special. I did not really reach
                the
                depth of research I would have wanted to. That's what happens when there's limited
                resources for Master's students. Still, I learned a lot from it. It definitely
                peaked my interest in accessibility, usability, and global website design trends.

            <h1>What does Sten like and dislike?</h1>
            <p class="p-2">
                Aaaw, you want to get to know me moore~? Well, since you're so curious, I
                like creative stuff, such as drawing, pottery, and painting. I also like building
                stuff, which means I like woodworking, knitting, home-making, and sewing. I
                love solving problems, which makes living alone easy as pie. If something is wrong
                in my apartment or I am missing something, I'll fix it by looking up the manual or
                finding a video about it, or I'll make the thing I am missing myself. Some people
                may prefer to save time and spend money by paying someone else to fix or make
                something for them, and I understand that. It's just not my vibe. Problem-solving is
                something that really makes me happy because it always results in a feeling of
                accomplishment and self-sufficiency.
            </p>
            <p class="p-2">
                I love a challenge, and by keeping an abundance
                of plants, I have something that shows both progression from my hard-work and
                something that gives me something back, like oxygen and hopefully fruits.
            </p>
            <p class="p-2">Dude, I
                looove everything horror. Although I am a bit of a worry-wart and wimp, I consume
                horror-stories or videos on the daily. I get easily scared. House-fires are my
                deepest fears (along with tics, horseflies, snakes, and bees).

                I study in a field of predominantly men. My class had three girls out of
                around 50 people. Can't say it is much different than a women-dominated field.
                Apparently, drama isn't exclusive to groups of girls, cause we've had a bunch of
                drama in the last year of our studies, all originating from guys. I thought
                drama would disappear as people becam adults.

            <p class="p-2">
                I already said I don't like bugs, but I equally do not like people who clearly value
                friends based on social groups. Loyalty, however clich√© it may sound, is sooo so
                important. It's insane how much people play fast and loose with friendships just to
                satisfy their needs or to find popularity. I don't like fake friends. Fake friends
                can eat a dick, then go hang out with other fake people (who can also eat a dick).

            <h1>Why make a website?</h1>
            <p class="p-2">
                Actually, the initial point of this website was to make something to show my
                development and design skills when I apply for jobs. Since,
                my main interest within IT is frontend, usability, and accessibility in website
                design, making a website seemed like
                the most obvious first step. But to make a website, I had to consider what tools to
                use. I previously made a very basic website using almost only HTML and CSS (and it
                looked like absolute dog shit). I have worked with Vue during my work at Hibox
                Systems (they make a bunch of stuff for a bunch of screens for a bunch of different
                customers) and I got to rewrite some of their pages into Vue. It was a great
                learning experience and that is why this website is implemented using Vue. I
                seriously considered working with React, as I have programmed a website for a course
                using it and it's <i>very popular</i>. However, Vue is more lightweight and easier
                to maintain. React did feel a bit overkill for a
                personalized website with blog-like content.

            <h1>Guide to Sten's website</h1>
            <p class="p-2">
                A little guide for this website might be good :) I was inspired by the 90s
                websites when the computer screens were much smaller (I'm implementing the website
                using
                my 3440x1440 monitor so I just simulate the struggle of having a smaller screen). I
                love love love the visual of 8-bit games and design, so obviously that's how I
                decided to design my website. The name of the website and the navigation bar is
                placed at the top of the screen. Obviously my name isn't Sten. I'd rather not put
                any personal info here. You never know what websites are scraped for data to train
                AI models.
            </p>
            <p class="p-2">
                There are horror stories I've written under <i>Content > Horror</i>, plant tips
                under <i>Content > Plant Tips</i>, and so on. If you happen to be a native Korean
                speaker,
                please(!) do not judge my short Korean texts on the <i>Korean Practices</i> page too
                harshly. I'm still new to writing Korean. There are also recipes and a page for
                stuff I have made, such as woodwork, sewing, and drawing. One page is
                dedicated to posting pictures I have taken, so it may load a bit slowly as it
                renders a
                bunch of images all at once (because I can't be bothered to try to make up
                categories
                and sort them).
            </p>
            <p class="p-2">
                I'd say my website is majorly focused on reading, so if you're not interested in
                that, I'd like to suggest that you get
                off my
                website instead of try to talk shit about how it is a bad website because it has too
                much
                text. My website just is not made for your teeny tiny attention span and not
                everything is made for everyone.

                It's worth noting that this page isn't made to be viewed on a small screen, such as
                a
                phone, and won't look great in that format. But also, who browses through
                websites on their phone? It is definitely the worst method for navigating a website.
                No
                mouse, just rawdogging a touchscreen by navigating through a bunch of nested lists
                and
                dropdown menus. Wym, you don't understand what I'm talking about?
                That's what websites do when they make a mobile version: simplify
                the
                design by
                pushing stuff into icons and dropdown menus to save screen-space. They don't realize
                that navigating through such a website is arguably more of a pain in the neck than
                having a bunch of functionality readily available on the page where it can be easily
                spotted and clicked on. This rant may or may not be fueled by some of the research I
                did for my Master's and I think it is a valuable point, but I digress for now.

                Whew! There's a lot more text than I thought there'd be. Apparently, I'm a yapper in
                text-form.
